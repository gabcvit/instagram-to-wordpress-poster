# wordpress-instagram-poster-bot
This repository is a personal experiment, by using Javascript and GitHub Actions I want to build a bot which will post new instagram content from a certain page to a Wordpress blog

Alert! Currently this project is not yet functional, I still need to finish implementing the core functionalities to fetch posts from instagram, filter the posts, convert to a "readable" Wordpress post and send it to Wordpress.
